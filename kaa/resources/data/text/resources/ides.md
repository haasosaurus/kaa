__**Well liked IDEs for coding in Python**__
:link: Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download> (free, fairly lightweight and extensible, my choice)
:link: PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/> (community edition is free, probably the best/easiest)
:link: Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/install> (good replacement for Python Interactive Shell)
:link: Spyder <https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html> (Good for data science, made with Python)
:link: Sublime Text 3 <https://www.sublimetext.com/3> (unlimited free trial, crackable, fast, lightweight, and extensible)
