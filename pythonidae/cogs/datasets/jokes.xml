                    Give a man a match, and he'll be warm for a few hours. Set a man on fire, and he will be warm for the rest of his life.

                    I asked a pretty, young homeless woman if I could take her home. She smiled at me and said yes. The look on her face soon changed as I walked away with her box.

                    "I have good and bad news," the doctor said to his patient.[newline]
                    "Give me the good news first," the patient said.[newline]
                    "Your test results are back," the doctor said, "and you have only two days to live."[newline]
                    "That's the good news?" the patient exclaimed. "What's the bad news?"[newline]
                    "I've been trying to reach you for two days."[newline]

                    Even people who are good for nothing have the capacity to bring a smile to your face. For instance, when you push them down the stairs.

                    "Relax," the operator tells him. "I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead."[newline]
                    There's silence, and then a gunshot.[newline]
                    The guy gets back on the phone and says, "OK, now what?"[newline]
